## What is AXI?

AXI is building the infrastructure for sustainable transportation in Africa. We're creating a platform that connects ride-hailing, delivery, and micro-mobility services while tracking their environmental impact through blockchain technology.

Think Uber + environmental rewards + community ownership, all built on transparent blockchain infrastructure.

### The Problem We're Solving

**Transportation in Africa faces three critical challenges:**

1. **Limited Infrastructure**: Existing ride-hailing and delivery platforms aren't built for African market conditions
2. **Environmental Impact**: Transportation contributes significantly to urban pollution, but there's no incentive structure for eco-friendly choices
3. **Economic Inequality**: Platform profits flow to overseas shareholders instead of local communities

### Our Solution

**Blockchain-Powered Mobility Ecosystem:**

- **Decentralized Platform**: Community-owned infrastructure where users share in platform value
- **Environmental Incentives**: Earn digital rewards for choosing eco-friendly transportation options
- **Transparent Operations**: All transactions, environmental impact, and platform decisions recorded on-chain
- **Multi-Service Integration**: Rides, deliveries, and micro-mobility in one unified platform

## How It Works

### For Users

1. **Book a ride** through the AXI Super App
2. **Choose eco-friendly options** (electric vehicles, shared rides, etc.)
3. **Earn rewards** automatically based on environmental impact
4. **Track your impact** through a virtual forest that grows with your contributions
5. **Participate in governance** using earned tokens to influence platform decisions

### For Drivers & Partners

1. **Join the network** with verified identity and vehicle registration
2. **Provide services** (rides, deliveries, vehicle sharing)
3. **Earn AXI tokens** in addition to fares for eco-friendly operations
4. **Co-own platform** through staking and governance participation

### For the Community

1. **Transparent operations** with all impact data recorded on blockchain
2. **Local ownership** through token distribution and governance
3. **Environmental benefits** tracked and verified in real-time
4. **Economic value** stays within local communities

## Technology Architecture

### Multi-Chain Blockchain Integration

We built our platform to work across multiple blockchain networks, giving users flexibility and reducing costs:

**Substrate Chains (Polkadot Ecosystem):**

- **Peaq Network**: Specialized for IoT and mobility use cases
- **DID Management**: Decentralized identity for vehicles, drivers, and users
- **Real-time Telemetry**: Processing sensor data from vehicles

**EVM Chains (Ethereum Compatible):**

- **Ethereum**: Main DeFi integrations and governance
- **Polygon**: Low-cost transactions for everyday operations
- **BSC & Avalanche**: Additional liquidity and user base access

### Core Components

## Key Features

### Decentralized Identity

Every participant (users, drivers, vehicles) has a blockchain-based identity that:

- Works across all supported networks
- Gives users control over their data
- Enables transparent verification without revealing private information
- Follows W3C standards for maximum compatibility

### Environmental Impact Tracking

Real-time monitoring of transportation choices:

- **Carbon footprint calculation** for every trip
- **Reward distribution** based on eco-friendly choices
- **Virtual forest visualization** showing collective environmental impact
- **Verified carbon credits** that can be traded or retired

### Dynamic Economics

Smart pricing and reward systems:

- **Fair pricing** calculated transparently on-chain
- **Surge pricing** with community-approved parameters
- **Driver incentives** for serving underserved areas
- **Environmental bonuses** for electric vehicle adoption

### Community Governance

Token-based decision making:

- **Platform parameters** (fee rates, reward distribution)
- **Service area expansion** decisions
- **Environmental initiative funding**
- **Partnership approvals**
